# Chronicl

> **Note:** This project is a work in progress and is under active refinement.

## Problem

Development teams rely on commit messages, pull-request descriptions and scattered documents to explain why code was written a certain way. This context often gets lost or is hard for AI assistants to consume. Without a single, evolving source of truth, onboarding slows down and automated tools miss the rationale behind each change.

## Solution

Chronicl introduces a single, root-level Markdown file—`chronicl.md`—that captures the ongoing narrative of your codebase. It lives alongside your code, evolves with each branch and gives both humans and AI the context they need to understand project goals, decisions and discoveries.

## Contents of `chronicl.md`

- **Project Overview**  
  High-level goals, target audience and scope.

- **Tech Stack and Contributors**  
  Key libraries, services and team members.

- **Design Decisions**  
  Architectural choices, trade-offs and the reasons behind them.

- **Ad-hoc Notes**  
  Insights from meetings, peer discussions and coding sessions.

- **Journal Entries**  
  Dated log of pivots, findings, risks and next steps.

## How to Use

1. **Initial setup**  
   Copy `template/chronicl.md` into your project root.

2. **Branch-level updates**  
   Whenever you start or finish work on a feature or bug fix, append concise bullet points under the relevant section.

3. **Review before merge**  
   Ensure entries are clear and up to date before merging back into the main branch.

4. **Ongoing maintenance**  
   Treat `chronicl.md` as a living document—keep it accurate as your project evolves.
