## CODEBASE OVERVIEW
chronicl.md is a development practice and template system that helps teams capture project narrative for better AI assistant context. The codebase consists of a README explaining the concept, a template directory for the chronicl.md structure, and supporting assets.

## MOTIVATION/ OBJECTIVES
- MO1: Solve the context gap between human developers and AI assistants by creating a living documentation practice
- MO2: Provide a standardised template that teams can adapt to capture design decisions, reasoning, and project evolution
- MO3: Enable AI assistants to understand project intent and avoid suggesting patterns that clash with established design decisions

## TECH STACK
- TS1: Markdown-based documentation system
- TS2: Git-based version control for tracking changes and collaboration
- TS3: Template system for easy adoption across projects

## CONTRIBUTORS
- C1: Minimal Mind (project creator and maintainer)

## DESIGN DECISIONS
- DC1: Chose markdown format for maximum compatibility and ease of use across different development environments
- DC2: Structured template with core sections (Overview, Motivation, Contributors, Design Decisions) plus flexible sections for team adaptation
- DC3: Journal-based approach with dated entries to maintain chronological context of project evolution
- DC4: Branch-to-entry ratio (1:1) to ensure comprehensive coverage of development activities

## RISKS
- R1: Teams may view this as additional documentation burden rather than a productivity tool
- R2: Template could become too rigid and not adapt to different team workflows
- R3: Without proper maintenance, the document could become outdated and lose its value

## OPEN ENDED
- OE1: How to encourage adoption across different development teams and company cultures?
- OE2: Should there be integrations with existing project management tools?
- OE3: How to measure the effectiveness of this practice on AI assistant performance?

## NEXT STEPS
- NS1: Gather feedback from early adopters to refine the template structure
- NS2: Create additional template variations for different project types (web apps, mobile, etc.)
- NS3: Develop best practices guide for teams implementing this practice

## NOTES
- N1: The practice emphasises living documentation over static documentation
- N2: Detailed entries provide better context for AI assistants than brief notes
- N3: The template is designed to be flexible while maintaining core sections for maximum impact
